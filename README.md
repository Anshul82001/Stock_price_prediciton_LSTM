# Stock_price_prediciton_LSTM
# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict stock prices using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as time series forecasting. In this project, we will train an LSTM model on historical stock price data and use it to make predictions for future stock prices.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
- Keras (version 2.3.1 or higher)
- Pandas (version 0.25.0 or higher)
- NumPy (version 1.17.0 or higher)
- Matplotlib (version 3.1.1 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshul82001/Stock_price_prediciton_LSTM.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Stock_price_prediciton_LSTM
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

After running the `Stock Price Prediction(LSTM).ipynb` script, you will obtain the predicted stock prices for the test data. You can evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices. Additionally, the script generates a plot showing the predicted prices overlaid on the actual prices for visual comparison.
